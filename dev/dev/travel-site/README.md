# Wanderly - Simple Travel Website

A clean, static site with Home, About, and Contact pages.

## Structure
- `index.html` - Home
- `about.html` - About
- `contact.html` - Contact
- `assets/css/styles.css` - Styles
- `assets/js/main.js` - Small JS for nav + form UX

## Run locally
Because this is a static site, you can simply open `index.html` in your browser.

Alternatively, serve the folder:

```bash
cd /Users/savanpatel/Desktop/dev/travel-site
python3 -m http.server 5173
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.
